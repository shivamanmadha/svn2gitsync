The following are the steps to integrate subversion 
with the Eclipse IDE. 
 
Subclipse With Eclipse : 
 
Subclipse is the Eclipse Subversion Plugin. 
 
Step 1  -  Install the latest Eclipse version 3.2.2. 
Eclipse 3.2.2 is 
available in JAVASHARE\\Softwares\\Java 
Related\eclipse-SDK-3.2.2-win32.zip 
 Note - Other Eclipse versions does not work 
properly. 
 
Step 2 - Get/Install the Subclipse plugin (subversion 
plugin). The following 
link lists the steps to install the Subclipse plugin. 
      
 https://www.projects.dev2dev.bea.com/Subversion%20Clients/Subclipse.html 
 
Step 3 - Install Tortoise SVN - GUI Subversion Client 
available at 
JAVASHARE\\Software\\svn\TortoiseSVN-1.4.3.8645-win32-svn-1.4.3.msi 
 
 
FAQS - 
1) How do I resolve the error 'Network Connection 
Problems Encountered during 
search' when I try to install the Subclipse? 
Ans - This problem comes when eclipse does not able 
to 
connect to the 
internet. To solve this enter the proxy server 
settings. Goto 
 Window -&gt;Preferences-&gt; Install/Update-&gt;Under Proxy 
Settings, select Enable 
HTTP Proxy connection. Enter Proxy Host address - 
198.162.18.254 and HTTP 
proxy host port - 3128. 
 
2) How do I start using subclipse ? 
Ans: The link mentioned in 'Step 2' itself describes 
basic usage of 
 subclipse. 
 
 
3) What is our repository URL? 
Ans: svn://198.162.18.9/cvs/svn/respositories 
 where $USER_ID is the user id given to you on the 
hosting server. All the projects are hosted under this 
repository path. You can 'check Out/Check 
In' 
a project of your 
interest. 
 
Note: Please let me know if you face any more 
problems, 
I will add them into 
FAQS section. This mail I will make available as a 
file at 
JAVASHARE\\Softwares\\svn\\HELP so that it will 
helpful 
to all of us and even 
for newcomers. 
 
 
Following section describes  'Reasons to go with 
CVS/SVN '. 
Reasons to go with CVS/SVN  - 
  CVS and SVN are the types of Versioning systems. 
These two work in 
 different ways. The following URL lists the 
differences between these two. 
http://www.pushok.com/soft_svn_vscvs.php 
Some of the advantages of using Subversion are listed 
below. 
    * Using SVN we can revert to older versions of a 
file, directory, or an 
entire website. 
    * Helps in case your hard drive dies 
    * Helps in case you changed something and wished 
you hadn't 
    * Helps in case you coded something and didn't 
realize it broke something 
else until later. 
    * Helps in case you are working in a project with 
one or more other 
people and needed a way to keep your files in sync 
    * Branching releases. Concurrently develop an 
unstable development 
 version as well as fix bugs in the stable production 
version. 
    * Multiple developers can work on the same 
catalog 
and even the same file 
at the same time. 
    * SVN is better than ftp for file transfer, 
because 
it automatically 
downloads only changed files, and even then, only the 
portion of the file 
that has changed (using patches). 
    * SVN can automatically merge two simultaneous 
writes to the same file by 
different developers. 
    * Allows one to keep track of the changes that 
have 
been made over time 
(many release managers repackage SVN commit logs into 
WHATSNEW, HISTORY, 
and/or NEWS files). 
   * Acts as a Central Repository bcaz of this taking 
backups would be easy, 
Administrator need not to take the backup from 
individual users. 
   Note : For more information you can also find many 
tutorial by just typing 
words like 'advantages CVS' (OR) 'Uses CVS'  (OR) 
'introduction cvs' etc.. in 
 google.
